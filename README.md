## Abstract ##
The pig is growing in popularity as an experimental animal because its gyrencephalic brain is similar to humans. 
Currently, however, there is a lack of appropriate brain templates to support functional and structural neuroimaging pipelines. 
The primary contribution of this work is an average volume from an iterative, non-linear registration of 70 five to seven month old male subjects. 
In addition several aspects of this study are unique, including the comparison of linear and non-linear template generation, the characterization 
of a large and homogeneous cohort, an analysis of effective resolution after averaging, and the evaluation of potential in-template bias as well as 
a comparison with a template from another minipig species using a “left-out” validation  set. 
We found that within our highly homogeneous cohort, non-linear registration produced better templates, but only marginally so. 
Although our T1-weighted data were resolution limited, we preserved effective resolution across the multi-subject average, 
produced templates that have high gray-white matter contrast and demonstrate superior registration accuracy compared to the only known alternative minipig template
